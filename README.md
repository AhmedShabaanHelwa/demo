# STM32F429ZI-Drivers

My design and development of drivers of STM32F429ZI MCU baed on ARM Cortex-M. The drivers are tested on STM32F429I-DISC1 evaluation kit.

The design and implementation is inspired from my absorbtion of knowledge gained form my coach: Mohamed Elzieny, Embedded Systems Design course at Embedded Systems track in ITI Egypt and instructed by Master Khaled Naga, STM32F4xx Standard Peripherlas Drivers, Jacob Beningo approach in his book " Reusable Firmware
Development A Practical Approach to APIs, HALs and Drivers " Apress 2017, AUTOSAR sepecifications, and different sources during lifelong learning.


The drivers libraries is based on ARM CMSIS V3.20
